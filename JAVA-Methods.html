        <h1 class="pageTitle">Methods</h1>
    
        <p>A method is block of code that is given a name and can be called wherever you want in a program. You could think of them as functions, and they are useful for when you need to do the same thing repeatedly within your code. You have actually been using built in methods within Java already. <code>System.out.println()</code>, <code>nextInt()</code>, <code>nextLine()</code>, <code>Math.pow()</code>, and all of your other math functions are methods.</p>

        <h3>Calling a method</h3>
        <p>When you call a method, you type its name followed by parenthesis with all of the parameters that it needs within in the parentheses separated by commas. The <code>Math.pow()</code> method requires two parameters: the base and the exponent.</p>
            
        <h3>Creating a method</h3>
        <p>When creating a method, you must consider what values the method will take in, what it will do with those values, and what value it will return. Here’s the syntax of a basic method:</p>
        <pre>modifierWords returnType methodName(parameters) {
    //code of your method
    returnStatement;
}</pre>
        <p>Modifier words are words like “public”, “private”, or “static”. You will learn more about these later, but for now just make your methods public (public essentially means other files can access this method like other classes) and static (static means you don’t have to create an object to use this method).</p>
        <p>The return type is the type of variable that the method will return back to you. Like the toRadians method will return a double back to you. A method does not have to return a variable, but you must put <code>void</code> when this happens</p>
        
        <p>You put the parameters within the parentheses. You must state the type of variable the parameter is and give it a name. You use these parameters as if they were normal variables within your variables by typing their name</p>
            
        <p>When the variable you want to return is ready, just type <code>return</code> and then the value you want to return. If your method does not return a variable (it is void) then you do not have to have a return statement.</p>
            
        <p>Here is an example of a method that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:</p>
        <pre>public class Temperature {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(toFahrenheit(0));
    }
    
    public static double toFahrenheit(double celsius) {
    return (celsius * 1.8) + 32;
    }
}</pre>
            
        <p>If you look at the header of the method, you can already tell that it will take in a double and then return a double. If you look in the code, you can see that it returns the value of a mathematical expression (the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit). In the main method (the first method that runs in the program), the toFahrenheit method is called, and the return value of it is printed on the console.</p>
            
        <p>Here is an example of a void method:</p>
        <pre>public static void sayHello(String firstName, String lastName) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName);
}</pre>
            
        <h3>Local Variables</h3>
        <p>Variables and parameters that are created within methods are called <b>local variables</b>, meaning they are local to that method. Local variables can’t be accessed by other methods. For example, if you made a variable called myNumber in your main method, and then made a variable called myNumber in another method, these variables will have no connection or association because method can’t access variables in other methods.</p>
            
        <h3>Global Variables</h3>
        <p>Global variables can be accessed from all methods in your class. You make a global variable just like you would any other variable, but you declare it outside of your method while remaining in your class. Here’s an example:</p>
        <pre>public class Person() {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    setName("Lisa");
    
    }
    
    public static void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }
    
    public static void setAge(int age) {
        age = age;
    }
}</pre>
        <p>In this code, there are two global variables called name and age. The main method, the setName method and the setAge method can all access these variables because they are global. </p>
        <p>The variables were made private because we do not want other classes accessing them (it is good programming practice), and you will learn more about this very soon, just know to make your global variables private for now.</p>
        <p>Look at the setAge method. There is actually an error in this code. Can you find it?</p>
        <p>The local variable in the method has the same name as the global variable in the class. <b>Local variables always take priority over global variables</b>. The user expects the method to change the value of the global age variable, but it actually just sets the local variable equal to itself, creating useless code. Pay attention to what you name your variables in your code.</p>
            
        <h3>Variable Parameters</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you want to pass in an unlimited amount of parameters into your function like a bunch of names for a data base or a set of numbers for statistical analysis. This is done with variable arguments aka variable parameters. To use them, you just put the variable type followed by 3 periods, a space and then the variable name like this <code>myMethod(String… names)</code>. This will allow you to pass in any number of variables, and access the variables with an array. You could do myMethod("Jim") or myMethod("Jim", "Jerry", "Joe") or any number of strings. The key is that you make sure the within your method is flexible enough to handle this.</p>
            
        <p>Passing in variable arguments actually creates an array within the method; therefore you can access each argument with <code>arrayName[index]</code>. You will most likely have to use the length of your array somewhere in your method to ensure that you are using all the values in your array. See exercise 2 below for practice with this.</p>
            
        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <p>Make a method called printUser that takes in 2 strings: firstName and lastName, and an int called age. Return one string that has the form “[firstName] [lastName] is [age] years old.” Only the method is necessary, you don’t have to write a whole class</p>
        <pre>public static String printUser(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    return firstName + " " + lastName + " " + age;
}</pre>
        <p>This might be a little more challenging, but it is a very useful method. Your task is to make a method called avg that takes in any number of doubles and returns the average of those doubles.</p>
        <pre>public static double avg(double... numbers) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (double x: numbers) {
        sum += x;
    }
    return sum / numbers.length;
}
</pre>
