        <h1 class="pageTitle">Control Statements</h1>
        <p>You have learned how to command the computer, and now you will learn how to let the computer make decisions for itself with control statements. It isn’t artificial intelligence, but it’s still pretty cool, and you will use these in just about every program you write</p>

        <h3>if statement</h3>
        <p>The if statement works the way you would expect. It says if this condition is true, then do this. Here’s what an if statement generally looks like.</p>
        <pre>x = 5
if x >= 5: 
    print("x is greater than or equal to 5")
</pre>    
        <p>The computer looks inside of the parentheses and evaluates if x is greater than or equal to 5. Since x is equal to 5, the program will print "X is greater than or equal to 5”.<b> Everything in your if clause must be indented one more level than the the actual if statement.</b> This is very important, and is pretty unique to Python because many languages do not look at indentation. The indentation tells the interpreter that these lines are what you want executed if the expression is True. This takes place of the curly brackets that you see in many other languages, and you will see this same rule used later in other aspects of Python.</p>
            
        <p>The if statement also works great with Booleans. Here’s an example</p>
        <pre>hasGlasses = False
if hasGlasses:
    print("Maggie has glasses")
</pre>

        <p>The statement will evaluate if the boolean hasGlasses is set to true. Since the statement is set to false, the code inside the curly brackets will not do anything.</p>
            
        <h3>if and else</h3>
        <p>In the case that your test condition is not true, you can use an else statement to do something “else”. For example,</p>
        <pre>x = 5
if x == 4:
    print("x is equal to 4")
else:
    print("Not sure what x is… but it is not 4")
</pre>
            
        <p>The == operator tests if 2 variables are equal. Whenever you want to see if something is equal, use ==. <b>DO NOT USE =</b>. The = is the assignment operator. It is only used to set something equal to something else. This program checks if x is equal to 4. Since it does not equal 4, it will run the code in the else statement.</p>
            
        <h3>elif</h3>
        <p>if and else statements are great if you only have 2 outcomes, but if you have more than one outcome then you’ll need an “eilf” statement. You essentially chain elif statements onto an if statement to check several conditions so your code can respond to different possibilities. Here is an example:</p>
            
        <pre>age = 19
if age &lt= 3:
    print("You are a toddler")
elif age &lt= 12:
    print("You are a kid")
elif age &lt= 17:
    print("You are a teen")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
</pre>
        <p>The code will start with the if statement and if true, then it will run the code inside the first if statement clause. If it is not true, then it will move on to the next condition and will repeat this process until it either reaches a condition that is true or it reaches the else statement. In this case, the code in the else statement will execute since 19 does not satisfy any of the conditions.</p>
            
            
        <h3>if vs elif</h3>
        <p>Why would you use an elif when you could just use multiple if statements?</p>
        <p>Answer: When you create an elif chain, code will only run in one of those elif segments. If you did multiple if statements then there’s a possibility that all of those statements can be True and run their respective code, so you need to figure out if you only want one thing to happen or potentially more.</p>
            
        <h3>and operator</h3>
        <p>Let’s say you only want a block of code to run when 2 conditions are true. You might be tempted to write something like this</p>
        <pre>canFly = True
hasSuperStrength = True
if canFly:
    if hasSuperStrength:
        print("You are superman")
</pre>
        <p>While this code is valid, it is not very easy to read and there is a simpler way. Take a look at this:</p>
        <pre>canFly = True
hasSuperStrength = True
if canFly and hasSuperStrength:
    print("You are superman")
</pre>
        <p>This is easier to read, easier to write, easier for the machine to run, and essentially equivalent to what was coded above. The <code>and</code> is the “and” operator, so if we translate this code to English, it would be like: “If canFly is True and if and only if hasSuperStrength is also True, then print "You are superman." Remember that the block of code will only be called if both of these conditions are True. If one of them is False, then the following code will be skipped.</p>
            
        <h3>or operator</h3>
        <p>Let's say you want a block of code to run if either one of the 2 conditions are true. You might want to write this:</p>
        <pre>canFly = True
hasSuperStrength = True
if canFly:
    print("You have super powers")
if hasSuperStrength:
    print("You have super powers")
</pre>
        <p>This code is alright, but if both of the expressions are true then the same statement will be printed twice. Here is another trick</p>
            
        <pre>canFly = True
hasSuperStrength = True
if canFly or hasSuperStrength:
    print("You have super powers")
</pre>
        <p>Once again, this is simpler and better. The <code>or</code> is the or operator, so in English this code says “If canFly is True or if hasSuperStrength is True, then you have super powers.” It will also print the statement at most one time, so there is no redundancy.</p>
            
        <p>If you ever find yourself writing a bunch of if statements or if statements nested inside of other if statements. Think about using one of these operators. Python is nice because the operators look like our normal language, so the code can almost be read by someone that can’t program.</p>
            
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Write a program that will print what kind of shape something is based off of these booleans: has4Sides, allSidesEqualLength, and allCorners90Degrees. The possible shapes are square, rectangle, other quadrilateral, or not a quadrilateral. Only print one of these in your option, not more than one. Hint: A square has 4 sides, all sides are equal length, and all corners are 90 degrees. A rectangle has 4 sides and all corners are 90 degrees. A shape is a quadrilateral if it has 4 sides.</p>
            
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <pre>if has4Sides and allSidesEqualLength and allCorners90Degrees:
        print("Square")
elif has4Sides and allCorners90Degrees:
    print("Rectangle")
elif has4Sides:
    print("Quadrillateral")
else:
    print("Not a quadrilateral")</pre>
            
        <p>There are many ways to do this, but this is one of the simplest ways. Notice how the code tests for the most specific case first, and then tests for more general cases as it goes down; you generally want to use this strategy for efficient code.</p>
